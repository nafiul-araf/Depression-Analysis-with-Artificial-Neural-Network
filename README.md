# Depression-Analysis-with-Artificial-Neural-Network
This neural network model predicts my depression or happiness(Very Good, Good, Normal, Bad, Very Bad) over some features. My model gives 94% training accuracy and 91% test accuracy with one hidden layer which have 11 neurons.

Note that: The dataset is my personal dataset. So It is not sharable in public. Just showing the process. In addition, you can also open this code in colab by clicking the link "open in colab".
