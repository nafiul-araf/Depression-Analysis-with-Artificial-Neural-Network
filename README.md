# Student Behavior Analysis with Machine Learning, Deep Learing Techniques


Note that: The dataset is my personal dataset. So It is not sharable in public. Just showing the process. In addition, you can also open the codes in colab by clicking the link "open in colab". 


# 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This neural network model predicts my depression or happiness(Very Good, Good, Normal, Bad, Very Bad) over some features. My model gives 94% training accuracy and 91% test accuracy with one hidden layer which have 11 neurons. 

Note that: To see the tensorboard, open .ipynb file in colab. 


# 2. Regression Analysis
I have used 7 types of regression models to predict my depression or happiness over some features. I used information gain method for feature selection. The 7 models gave me different train and accuracy and I have selected the best models for my problem. 

Note that: The summary to find the best models has been added in the last cell of .ipynb file.


# 3. Decision Tree
I have used decision tree classifier with both default crition (gini) and non-default criterion (entropy), respectively. In addition, I have also tuned hyperparameter with both grid search cv and randomized search cv, respectively to get the best parameters.


# 4. Kmeans Clustering
To find the different groups of item with same characteristics, I have used Kmeans clustering by analyzing and visualizing the same technique in many ways. Finally, I have created two models with 9 clusters and 8 clusters, respectively.
