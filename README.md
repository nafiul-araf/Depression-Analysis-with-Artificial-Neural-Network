# Student Behavior Analysis with Machine Learning, Deep Learing Techniques


Note that: The dataset is my personal dataset. So It is not sharable in public. Just showing the process. In addition, you can also open this code in colab by clicking the link "open in colab" to see the tensorboard also.


# 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This neural network model predicts my depression or happiness(Very Good, Good, Normal, Bad, Very Bad) over some features. My model gives 94% training accuracy and 91% test accuracy with one hidden layer which have 11 neurons.


# 2. Regression Analysis
I have used 6 types of regression models to predict my depression or happiness over some features. I used information gain method for feature selection. The 6 models gave me different train and accuracy and I have selected the best models for my problem.
